  summary: `ENSO ATLAS ANALYSIS SUMMARY

Case ID: slide-001
Analysis Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
Task: Bevacizumab Response Prediction

PREDICTION:
The model predicts this case as "Bevacizumab Responder" with high confidence (probability: 78%).

KEY FINDINGS:
The analysis identified several morphological features associated with treatment response:

1. Prominent papillary architecture with high-grade nuclear features in the primary tumor regions
2. Significant tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte presence at the tumor-stromal interface
3. Characteristic necrosis pattern that may indicate tumor vasculature susceptibility to anti-angiogenic therapy

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
The model identified 6 high-attention regions that contributed most to this prediction. The top 3 evidence patches showed morphological patterns including papillary carcinoma architecture, immune infiltration, and necrosis distribution that align with responder cases in the reference cohort.

SIMILAR CASES:
Comparison with the reference cohort identified 3 similar cases with matching morphological patterns. Two of three similar cases were confirmed responders in the training data.
